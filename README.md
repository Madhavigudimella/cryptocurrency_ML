# cryptocurrency_ML

Unsupervised Learning jupyter notebook reads the data related to different cryptocurrencies and attempts to cluster them using PCA (Dimensionality Reduction) and K-Means.
The analysis shows that based on the given data, we cannot cluster crypto currencies into meaningful segments.
I propose to expand the dataset with more features and retest the model.
